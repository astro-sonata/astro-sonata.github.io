My research interest include stellar kinematics (runaway, "walkaway", and hyper-velocity stars), core-collapse and (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae, X-ray binaries, time-domain and gravitational-wave astronomy. I mainly use analytical and numerical simulations to understand massive star evolution, their explosions, and how they interact in binary systems. I use both detailed stellar structure and evolution models (e.g., with MESA, and rapid population synthesis (e.g., with binary c or COSMIC). I am learning to run hydrodynamical simulations (with ATHENA++).</p></p>

					<p>
						Dr. Nathan Smith is interested in understanding the evolution and fate of
						massive stars, and their influence on the surrounding interstellar medium. His primary focus is on the violent explosions and eruptions that occur as a massive star approaches its death, especially those of the most massive and luminous stars known. Although these stars drive the energetics of the interstellar medium and are extremely bright and easy to observe, the way they reach their demise and finally explode is still very poorly understood. Nathan specializes in multiwavelength spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging of supernovae and other transients in order to study explosions observed in real time, and he studies spatially resolved circumstellar material in order to constrain the physical properties of mass-loss episodes that have occurred in the past.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another main area of interest is the evolution of massive star-forming regions, where energy input from the radiation, winds, and explosions of massive stars can influence star and planet formation in the surrounding cloud. Nathan performs detailed mutiwavelength studies of nearby stellar nurseries, working toward a complete picture of the complex processes that dominate the massive star-forming environment, trying to understand the interplay between star death and birth. This impacts our own origins, since the Solar system is thought to have formed in such a region, probably exposedto nearby supernovae.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nathan conducts observations using the Hubble Space Telescope and other NASA missions, plus numerous ground-based optical/infrared telescopes. Although primarily an observer, he incorporates theoretical tools in his work, and has a broad interest in Galactic astronomy including stellar evolution, mass loss, circumstellar material, shock physics, HII regions, disks, jets, planetary nebulae, dust formation, and nebular spectroscopy. Nathan earned undergraduate degrees in music and astronomy, plus a master's degree and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics.</p>

					<summary><strong>About</strong></summary>

					<p>
						Hi, I'm an Assistant Astronomer at NSF's NOIRLab in Tucson, AZ, and was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. My research focuses on massive evolved stars, infrared transients, dust production/destruction, obscured high-mass x-ray binaries, and star formation.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm an infrared astronomer, which is a tricky wavelength to observe since almost everything around us (on Earth) is emitting infrared photons like crazy, and water vapor in our atmosphere absorbs infrared photons from the astronomical targets we are interested in. However, we can overcome these challenges with observatories up on the highest mountains on Earth, observatories that fly into the stratosphere, and observatories up in space. This is why it's great having awesome facilities like Keck, Subaru, Gemini, SOFIA, and JWST.
					</p>
					<p>
						The science that we can learn from these infrared observatories is absolutely worth it. In the infrared, we can peer into the densest clouds to reveal the birth of new stars, probe the material ejected from massive stars as they near the end of their lives, and even trace the outcome of merging neutron stars that also produce gravitational waves signatures.

							My research focuses on the evolution of cool supergiant stars, with the aim of constraining the progenitor-supernova-remnant connection. I do this using both observations and stellar evolution models of red supergiants, yellow supergiants, and supernovae remnants. I am also interested in using massive stellar populations (such as Westerlund 1) as a tool for understanding single and binary stellar evolution. Ultimately, I hope to determine which stars explode, what those explosions look like, and which fail to explode entirely.

	      					I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Astronomy and Astrophysics at Steward Observatory, University of Arizona. I graduated with a B.A. in Astrophysics and Physics from Harvard University in 2023, where I worked with the Berger Cosmic Transients Lab on the optical study of Type I superluminous supernovae and UV analysis of their host galaxies, as well as applying machine learning techniques in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

            			<p>
	      					Currently, I am working with Prof. Nathan Smith and Dr. Grant Williams on studying the simultaneous temporal evolution of spectropolarimetric, spectroscopic, and photometric properties of Type IIn supernovae.

							Vikram is a theoretical and computational astrophysicist whose research focuses on the multi-messenger nature of compact objects such as binary black holes, neutron stars, supernovae, and other high-energy transients. He uses numerical relativity and magnetohydrodynamic simulations, such as Einstein Toolkit, IllinoisGRMHD,  and Athena++, to study these systems in a variety of contexts. His current work focuses on the late-time evolution of accreting supermassive black hole binaries in the LISA band. Future work will hopefully expand the current numerical framework to study core-collapse supernova and other high-energy transients.

							Jeniveve focuses on studying young supernovae in the nearby universe to understand their progenitors and explosion mechanisms. She is also interested in late-stage red supergiants, particularly on the higher mass end (18-30 M$_\odot$), and predicting the final moments of their lives. Jeniveve has been a PhD student working under David Sand since 2020, when she came to University of Arizona after graduating with a B.S. from The Ohio State University with a double major in Physics and Astrophysics and a minor in Studio Art.
